/**
 * The one thing you have to fill in yourself.
 *
 * Both two-player-over-the-internet and the shared score board need a server:
 * two browsers cannot find each other on their own, and a board that lives in
 * one browser is not a board anybody else can see. Everything else in this game
 * runs off static files, and this is the single line that changes that.
 *
 * It can point at the same relay as websoccer, webtennis or webracing - the
 * relay does not know or care which game is talking to it - but it should not,
 * because the board does not survive the trip: a run of eleven stages and a
 * football scoreline are not the same shape, and they share one Durable Object.
 * A Worker of this game's own is two commands. See worker/README.md.
 *
 * Leave it empty and the game still plays: on your own, two round one keyboard
 * or a pair of gamepads, and your own score board. Only the shared parts go
 * quiet.
