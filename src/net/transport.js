 *
 *    transport.sample(tick)   record (and send) this machine's input
 *    transport.ready(tick)    are we allowed to simulate this tick?
 *    transport.poll(tick)  -> [mask0, mask1]
 *    transport.afterStep(state)
 *
 * Locally everything comes from the keyboard and the gamepads; online the other
 * half of it comes from one other person. The simulation cannot tell the
 * difference - which is why adding online co-op needed no changes to sim.js at
 * all.
 *
 * This is webracing's netcode with the four turned back into two, which is where
 * it came from in the first place. The shape is identical and the idea is
 * identical; the only thing that changed is how many seats there are to wait
 * for, and waiting for one is a great deal cheaper than waiting for three.
